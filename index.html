        <p>"Written Questions:" </p>
        <p>"1. The graph on the top left of the page answers the first question by displaying the top ten video games of all time, in order,
          as determined by the number of global sales. I used global sales instead of the sales of any particular
          region because the the boss didn't specify a region and could be dealing with multiple regions.
          The map on the right of the page answers the 2nd question as to which genre is most popular in each region.
            I aggregated the total number of sales per genre in a given region and displayed the top genre sold in each
            region as a color on the map. The map at the bottom answers the 3rd question by displaying the top
            publisher per genre, as determined by global sales. I aggregated the total number
            of sales within a genre for each publisher and displayed
            the top ten publishers for that genre so that the boss can see which publisher sold the best." </p>
        <p>"2. D3 could be helpful if you had a large dataset and wanted to include dynamic labels.
          It could also be helpful if you wanted to focus on accessability since D3 includes
          a broad library of color schemes. D3 is also useful for having a wide variety of built in graph types
          for complicated datasets, such as  map and flow type graphs.   " </p>
        <p>"3. One reason D3 would not be the best tool because it can be needlessly complicated and would not
          be an appropriate tool for less tech-savvy people to use. Another reason to not use is if
          you wanted to do data visualization on a browser that doesn't support D3. Another reason could be if you
          were working on a very large data visualization project and you needed to use a more modern framework that
          handled more of the groundwork for you. " </p>
        <p>"Accessible Data Visualization:" </p>
        <p>"4. Colorblind and visually impaired users could have had trouble with this my graphs. It's also
          possible that it wouldn't work for mobile-only users.  From the betterment article, I
          learned also isn't compatible with accessibility add-ins like voice-over   " </p>
        <p>"5. I could have made my fonts larger so that the visually impaired could read
          my graphs better. I could have also done more research on appropriate
          color schemes for colorblind people " </p>
